Hello! My name is Bohan. I'm a PhD Candidate in the Health Policy Management at Harvard Business School. My research interests are at the intersection of health economics, management and organizational economics. My current work focuses on issues of ownership in the U.S. healthcare, spanning providers and payers. 

Prior to graduate school, I worked as a management consultant in New York City. I earned my BA from the University of Pennsylvania in chemistry and economics.
